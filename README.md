# Swap Virtual Desktop
Adds keyboard shortcuts to KWin that swap the windows of the current virtual desktop with those of the next/previous/upper/lower desktop. When swapping to the 0th/last+1 desktop, a new desktop will be added to make the swap possible.
Default shortcuts are: Meta+Shift+Alt+Right/Left/Up/Down. These can be changed in System Settings → Global Shortcuts → KWin → (search for SWAP DESKTOP)
